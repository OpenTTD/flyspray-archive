15:16	<@Alberth>	hackalittlebit: sorry, I don't get that developer reference
15:17	<frosch123>	222 KiB ?
15:17	<frosch123>	oh, it's a zip, no diff :p
15:17	<@Alberth>	1296910 07-03-2012 10:09 19440_gui_wg.patch
15:17	<@Alberth>	slightly bigger :D
15:17	<hackalittlebit>	:)
15:18	<frosch123>	something is broken about your diff generator
15:18	<Zuu>	Are nested ? statements allowed in OpenTTD?
15:18	<frosch123>	i think it diffed dos vs. unix end-of-lines
15:18	<@Alberth>	it appended \r after all lines
15:19	<@Alberth>	Zuu: ?
15:19	<Zuu>	Eg: colour = dead? COLOUR_RED : (paused? COLOUR_YELLOW : COLOUR_GREY);
15:19	<@Alberth>	sure
15:19	<frosch123>	Zuu: add a linebreak after the first :
15:19	<frosch123>	then you might find multiple occurences in ottd
15:19	<hackalittlebit>	Alberth: I will check my settings
15:20	<Zuu>	hmm and a space before ?
15:20	<frosch123>	yeah
15:21	<@Alberth>	hackalittlebit: I don't seem to have such a setting in my config file
15:22	<hackalittlebit>	I'll read instructions again :(
15:23	<hackalittlebit>	are you able to apply patch?
15:23	<hackalittlebit>	using hg
15:25	<frosch123>	Hirundo: Yexo: are you using hg on windows?
15:26	<@Alberth>	hackalittlebit: yep
15:27	<@Alberth>	actually I use 'patch'
15:28	<@Alberth>	hackalittlebit: does http://paste.openttdcoop.org/show/1513/ look ok to you at first sight?
15:29	<@Alberth>	diff has no \r any more, so that's good :)
15:29	<hackalittlebit>	those are the files I changed
15:30	<hackalittlebit>	forget music
15:30	<hackalittlebit>	dmusic
15:30	<@Alberth>	it is a bit empty now :)
15:31	<hackalittlebit>	ok ok I'll try again
15:31	<hackalittlebit>	:)
15:33	<@Alberth>	you should try to limit the amount of lines that you touch while making changes
15:33	<@Alberth>	lines that only change in amount of white space also end up here, and get mixed with real changes
15:34	<hackalittlebit>	so maybe better to hold on and I will do some cleaning.
15:34	<@Alberth>	it would be great if you can separate these two from each other as much as possible, that is, make a patch that only changes white space, or make a patch that only changes code
15:35	<@Alberth>	the former can then very easily skipped reading
15:35	<hackalittlebit>	ok
15:36	<@Alberth>	the down-side is that you get a sequence of patches
15:36	<hackalittlebit>	I can't read that patch, it is just for testing alberth
15:37	<@Alberth>	do you want the cleaned up patch back?
15:37	<hackalittlebit>	no I will do it here
15:37	<hackalittlebit>	thanks

15:42	<@Alberth>	I mean you removed some strings in the english.txt file, but not in all other languages

15:44	<frosch123>	hackalittlebit: but don't remove them, unless you know sed or simliar :)
15:45	<@Alberth>	such changes should also be grouped away from "real" changes, as they clutter the patch
15:45	<hackalittlebit>	hu
15:46	<hackalittlebit>	alberth but did it compile?
15:46	<@Alberth>	hackalittlebit: with sed, you can change all language files in a minute, by hand it takes you a lot more time :)
15:46	<@Alberth>	so if you don't know sed, we can do that :)
15:46	<@Alberth>	it compiled!
15:47	<hackalittlebit>	hurray!!
15:47	<hackalittlebit>	sed? notepad++
15:49	<@Alberth>	that can automatically change 50+ files in one go?

15:50	<@Alberth>	the "random game" was confusing to me at the top-left, I tried clicking it, and it did nothing
15:51	<@Alberth>	Zuu: not my work, all done by hackalittlebit
15:51	<Zuu>	Shoud the "random game" be depressed like a tab?
15:51	<hackalittlebit>	here it opens option screen
15:51	<frosch123>	Zuu: fs#5147
15:52	<hackalittlebit>	zuu: one of the thing I wan't to talk about
15:52	<hackalittlebit>	That button is not nescessary
15:53	<hackalittlebit>	just give the four corner buttons
15:53	<@Alberth>	http://devs.openttd.org/~alberth/world_gen_advanced.png and it has hidden extras too, I found :D
15:54	<@Alberth>	so it seems to be mostly working
15:55	<Zuu>	Hmm, the CargoMonitorTestGS is useful to test my patch for FS#n+1 :-)
15:55	<@Alberth>	he, I was not done with that yet :)
15:56	<Zuu>	I'm adding scipt dead status to the gs button in the AI debug window
15:56	<Zuu>	So that I in FS#5206 can add paused status to it too.
15:57	<hackalittlebit>	Albert: if all 4 buttons are freeform in fact that means boders are random no?
15:58	<fuzxl>	Is it possible to start a game where all companies are controlled by AIs
15:59	<Rubidium>	hackalittlebit: no, freeform means there's no ocean, the order means there is. With freeform there might be some water, but it's not quite the same
15:59	<hackalittlebit>	thanks
16:00	<Zuu>	Is the comma correct in this sentence:
16:00	<Zuu>	* @param paused true if the scirpt is paused, otherwise false
16:00	<Zuu>	?
16:00	<andythenorth>	ho ho ho

16:02	<Rubidium>	actually, dedicated server + enough start_ai calls would do the trick
16:04	<@Alberth>	Zuu: comma seems fine by me, if s/scirpt/script/
16:05	<@Alberth>	I was pondering about "Whether or not the script is pasued" but that seems more ambigious
16:05	<Zuu>	Thanksfully the "scirpt" was just a typo in IRC so no patch needs updating :-)
16:05	<@Alberth>	*paused, even
16:05	<Zuu>	Some AI/GS docs say "if and only if ... "
16:05	<@Alberth>	iff, for short :)
16:06	<Supercheese>	Reminds me of that xkcd, "Honk IFF you love formal logic." (or some such)
16:06	<fuzxl>	Alberth: Thank you!
16:07	<@Alberth>	that's because "if" is one direction only "A if B" says that A holds if B holds, but it does not say anything about A when B does not hold
16:07	<fuzxl>	Forth love if honk then
16:09	<@Alberth>	fuzxl: you noted Rubidium said the opposite of me right? and he is about 99.9% likely tobe correct

16:10	<@Alberth>	good point, splitting pixels is dirty business
16:14	<hackalittlebit>	Alberth: I did not find proc to hide widget (invisible), does it exist?
16:14	<fuzxl>	Are there any eastereggs in OpenTTD?
16:15	<@Alberth>	hackalittlebit: somewhat depends on the context where you want to do it
16:15	<@Alberth>	the simplest approach but expensive approach is to ReInit() the window, and make some widgets 0 size horizontally or vertically
16:16	<fuzxl>	Alberth: Thank you for the information. I am not very into OpenTTD yet...
16:16	<hackalittlebit>	ok I will play with that
16:17	<@Alberth>	another approach is a tab-book(?) like approach, where you have several equally sized planes of widgets, and you can switch between these planes very cheaply
16:17	<@Alberth>	I'd have to search for an example but they do exist in the current windows
16:19	<@Alberth>	fuzxl: that's ok :) nice thing is that you can still enjoy playing with the game :)
16:19	<@Alberth>	I played the game too often :)
16:20	<@Alberth>	hackalittlebit: NWidgetStacked is the tab-thingie
16:21	<fuzxl>	Alberth: OpenTTD is totally fun!
16:21	<hackalittlebit>	Alberth: tnks :)
16:21	<fuzxl>	BTW, are there any other (free) sprite sets that replace the basic sprites?
16:22	<@Alberth>	fuzxl: lol, do you have any idea how much work that is?
16:22	<fuzxl>	Well... a little bit
16:22	*	andythenorth ship cropped
16:23	<fuzxl>	I think there are about 1000 sprites to replace
16:23	<@Alberth>	fuzxl: people are working on a 32bpp version, and they can use a lot of help :)
16:23	<andythenorth>	requirement for setx chopped
16:23	<@Alberth>	fuzxl: more like 10,000 per climate
16:23	<@Alberth>	but some stuff is shared
16:24	<hackalittlebit>	Alberth: random map button works after loading height map.(returns to normal map gen window)
16:24	<@Alberth>	many sprites that you see actually consist of many smaller sprites
16:24	<@Alberth>	hackalittlebit: ah, didn't try that, perhaps disable it at first then?
16:31	<andythenorth>	planetmaker: hi hi
16:32	<+michi_cc>	Random map should started depressed then I guess.
16:33	<@Alberth>	good point

16:37	<@Alberth>	combine?
16:38	<hackalittlebit>	most of the strings are equal
16:38	<@Alberth>	hackalittlebit: in general, if you can re-use strings that's fine
16:38	<@Alberth>	in particular if you use them for the same purpose, so translations still hold

16:39	<Zuu>	frosch123: The user want to forbid towns to build roads that are parallell with the bridge above it?
16:39	<@Alberth>	hackalittlebit: if it messes up translations, we can always duplicate them afterwards
16:39	<frosch123>	Zuu: you mean a personal subjective reasoning?
16:39	<Zuu>	Not sure if he want to have a general rule against it or only in dead-end situations.
16:39	<frosch123>	i see no reason to forbid that
16:40	<frosch123>	it would also forbid building bridges over roads
16:40	<Zuu>	In his particular case, that road doesn't make any sense. But there are situations when a road bellow and parallell to the bridge makes sense.
16:40	<+michi_cc>	Can look ugly though, check the bridge at the right: http://www.icosahedron.de/openttd/patches/junction.png
16:40	<hackalittlebit>	Alberth that means patch will grow bigger :)
16:40	<Zuu>	I think his suggestion was only to forbid towns to build like that, not to remove the 0.7 feature to have roads like that.
16:41	<Zuu>	(or was that in 0.6?)
16:41	<@Alberth>	hackalittlebit: "afterwards" was intended as "after your patch is finished"
16:41	<frosch123>	Zuu: i thought 0.5 :p
16:41	<Zuu>	Maybe even back then. :-)
16:42	<frosch123>	ok, there are no houses under bridges,
16:42	<frosch123>	so towns are indeed more likely to build roads there
