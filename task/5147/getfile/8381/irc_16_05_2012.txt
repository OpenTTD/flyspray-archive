17:41	<frosch123>	are you ny timezone btw?
17:41	<hackalittlebit>	greenwich meantime
17:42	<frosch123>	you confused me earlier when you left and it was already evening for me :p
17:42	<hackalittlebit>	22.42 here
17:43	<hackalittlebit>	43
17:43	<Rubidium>	then you're not in GMT
17:43	<hackalittlebit>	summertime
17:43	<frosch123>	anyway, about fs#5147: "play scenario" is quite hidden
17:43	<frosch123>	i would not search it under "load game"

17:44	<hackalittlebit>	I saw it, I would like to combine difficulty setting with game settings
17:44	<hackalittlebit>	I mean all settings together
17:45	<hackalittlebit>	even transparity
17:45	<frosch123>	transparency is a toolbar currently, which seems more suitable for me
17:45	<frosch123>	i would think we should approach this more slowly
17:46	<hackalittlebit>	agree
17:46	<frosch123>	first difficulty settings. i think we can remove the window completely by removing everything that is in worldgen or ai settings, and move the rest to adv. settings
17:46	<frosch123>	next could be the music settings or newspaper settings
17:47	<frosch123>	music settings could turn into sound settings and also take the basesound and basemusic stuff from game options
17:47	<frosch123>	that would basically leave the current game settings as some kind of video and localisation settings
17:48	<frosch123>	well, and then i am afraid to think any further :p
17:50	<Rubidium>	only those sound settings would be available from in game, but you can't change the sound set there
17:53	<hackalittlebit>	rubidium: is it difficult to find out what settiings you can change in-game , global, only before creating new game?
17:54	<hackalittlebit>	maybe try to split them up like that
17:54	<Rubidium>	not really
17:54	<Rubidium>	only caveat is that the set differs between normal games and MP games
17:55	<hackalittlebit>	auch even more :(
17:55	<Rubidium>	even then, almost all settings can be set from the main menu
17:55	<Rubidium>	except video/music/sound driver and a few like that
17:55	-!-	Progman [~progman@p57A1BBC2.dip.t-dialin.net] has joined #openttd

18:02	<hackalittlebit>	frosch123: play scenario could be visible if there would be only one button to change settings
18:02	<frosch123>	you could also readd content download :p
18:03	<frosch123>	anyway, the number of settings windows is quite unknown at the moment
18:03	<frosch123>	so, maybe the intro screen should be postponed a bit

18:04	<frosch123>	while putting everything into a single settings windows might sound clean, it would be quite hard for the novice user to just change the language
18:05	<frosch123>	so, for a start we could just go for the difficulty and news settings windows
18:06	<frosch123>	i am quite confident that we can remove them completely
18:06	-!-	FLHerne [~francis_h@dsl-217-155-24-22.zen.co.uk] has left #openttd []
18:06	<frosch123>	by moving everything to adv. settings which is not alread yin some other settings window
18:06	<frosch123>	we just need an excuse to trash the highscore :p
18:08	<hackalittlebit>	2 less is allready great:)
18:08	<Zuu>	Or add highscore recording to NoGo. :-)
18:08	<CIA-1>	OpenTTD: frosch * r24260 /trunk/src/ (station_gui.cpp vehicle_gui.cpp vehiclelist.cpp): -Change [FS#5126]: Make the oilrig-vehicle list accessible to specators and colour it's caption neutrally grey.
18:09	<frosch123>	Zuu: currently we have 4 high score lists for the four difficulty levels
18:09	<frosch123>	but since the difficulty levels make absolutely no sense, the highscore lists are also quite useless
18:09	<Zuu>	Yes its an insane idea as there will end up one high score list for each nogo script and really for each parameter set of nogo.
18:10	<frosch123>	we could merge them into a single one, i.e. the "custom" one
18:10	<frosch123>	but, we would still have to find a place to view it
18:10	<hackalittlebit>	can it be outside the game?
18:10	<hackalittlebit>	I guess not
18:10	<frosch123>	nogo can communicate with external stuff, e.g. some database
18:11	<frosch123>	but i am not aware of anyone doing that :)
18:11	<frosch123>	the goal servers do something like that, but i doubt they use nogo
18:12	<Zuu>	nogo can communicate with external stuff through the admin port when run on a MP server. And in that case it is up to the server owner to track the highscore and publish it on a web-server.

18:12	<frosch123>	well, i think the highscore only applies to singleplayer, doesn't it?
18:12	<Zuu>	yes (only sp)
18:12	<frosch123>	or is mp interrupted in 2050 to display the highscore screen? :p
18:14	<hackalittlebit>	frosch123: move the high score to http://bugs.openttd.org/task/5147/getfile/8378/menu_v4.html#STR_GRAPH_MENU_OPERATING_PROFIT_GRAPH
18:16	<hackalittlebit>	together with other stats

18:16	<Zuu>	Isn't it better to have highscore in the main menu?
18:16	<hackalittlebit>	you mean start up?
18:16	<Zuu>	Its only recorded when you reach 2050 in a game.
18:17	<Zuu>	Eg, its not continues through a game. (though I beleive it is the company performance measure that is the basis for high score)

18:19	<frosch123>	hackalittlebit: in game i could imagine it in the company league table or in the detailed performance rating
18:19	<frosch123>	the graphs feel quite unrelated
18:19	<frosch123>	not sure whether we need it in the main screen
18:19	<frosch123>	it's so damn unimportant :)
18:19	<hackalittlebit>	So but it on startup screen.
18:20	<hackalittlebit>	under the climate change buttons
18:20	<hackalittlebit>	devides the screen in two
18:20	<frosch123>	currently i think just putting it into the company league table is enough
18:20	<Zuu>	frosch123: Yes for advanced players its unimportant and when you start to fiddle with settings it makes the high score uncomparable. However, for novice players it might be an interesting goal trying to beat the high score.
18:20	<frosch123>	i don't think it needs to be accessible from the main screen
18:21	<frosch123>	Zuu: we have no prerecorded highscores :p
18:21	<frosch123>	it's only against yourself
18:21	<hackalittlebit>	I never looked at it:)
18:21	<frosch123>	i remember some game which had prerecorded highscores with random names attached to them

18:22	<Zuu>	That would be something, recorded high scores downloadable via bananas :-)
18:22	<Zuu>	... or not ...
18:22	<hackalittlebit>	lol
18:22	<frosch123>	the highest highscore had the name of the developer, and the game was designed in a way that it ran faster the more close you came to that highscore.
18:23	-!-	eQualizer [~lauri@dyn-xdsl-77-86-195-47.nebulazone.fi] has joined #openttd
18:23	<frosch123>	(it was a tetris-like game where you loose when stuff gets too fast for you)
18:23	<frosch123>	so, effectively you could never beat the original developer
18:23	<frosch123>	(except with a hexeditor :p )
18:24	<Zuu>	So some daylength patch should be changed so that the daylength is shortened as you reach the top highscore recorded by some OpenTTD developer :-)
18:25	<frosch123>	anyway, i think currently the highscores are quite hidden - i think it took me years to notice the button in the difficulty settings - and the company league table is a more intuitive place for it
18:25	<hackalittlebit>	company league table, sounds fine to me
18:26	<hackalittlebit>	frosch123: Didn't want to say it , but it took me till last week to see that button.
18:26	<Zuu>	Sounds good.
18:26	<frosch123>	hackalittlebit: does not surprise me :p i think noone notices it
18:27	<Zuu>	I didn't know about it untill now that you can view it from the difficulty window.

18:41	<hackalittlebit>	did you see :)
18:41	<frosch123>	i would have named it "random map" just as well, instead of "manual"
18:41	<frosch123>	but yes, that window makes sense

18:44	<hackalittlebit>	yes
18:45	<hackalittlebit>	ok , I like that
18:47	<hackalittlebit>	'Load Heightmap' should be 'Create from Heightmap?
18:47	<frosch123>	no idea, both works for me
18:48	<frosch123>	load heightmap fits more with load scenario
18:48	<frosch123>	and technically you can also save your scenarios as heightmap
18:48	<frosch123>	so, it is not necessarily a "create", but could also be an "edit"
