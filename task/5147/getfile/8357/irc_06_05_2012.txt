17:49	hackalittlebit	frosch123: what is max screen size acceptable for new game in px?
17:50	hackalittlebit	world generation screen
17:50	Rubidium	s/max screen/max window/?
17:51	hackalittlebit	the opening screen
17:51		*** Rhamphoryncus quit (Quit: Rhamphoryncus)
17:51	Rubidium	so you mean window
17:51	Rubidium	then 640x480
17:51	hackalittlebit	when you click 'new game'
17:53	Rubidium	as the maximum screen size is only bound by what your operating system allows or 32k pixels each size (whichever is smaller)
17:54	hackalittlebit	yes but would you allow a ingame screen to totally cover everything else?
17:55	hackalittlebit	I would not
17:55	hackalittlebit	so what would be acceptable
17:55	Eddi|zuHause	hackalittlebit: all windows should have a version that displays properly on a 640x480 screen
17:56	Alberth	hackalittlebit: nobody runs OpenTTD at an 640x480 screen
17:57	Alberth	making that the size of a window is fine; technically you can still use the program as all windows can be displayed, but nobody is ever going to do that
17:58	TrueBrain	s/is ever going to do/should be doing/
17:58		TrueBrain wistles while he changes his res back from 640x480
17:59	Alberth	TrueBrain: they should use a smaller font and make a small gui sprite set
17:59	hackalittlebit	alberth: is size of popup screen related to size of computer screen?
17:59	Alberth	no, only to its contents
18:00	Alberth	except 'contents' is not fixed either; people use bigger fonts and/or big gui sprites
18:00	Alberth	but for design you don't need to take that into account
18:00	hackalittlebit	so could you not establish max initial popup size?
18:01	hackalittlebit	that you find acceptable
18:01	Alberth	640x480 too big?
18:01	hackalittlebit	I think so.
18:02	Alberth	popup has by definition little content, so if you need 640x480, it has too much information, I think
18:03	Alberth	a realistic minimal screen size is around 1024x768 I think, so 640x480 is ok
18:04		*** roadt quit (Ping timeout: 480 seconds)
18:04	hackalittlebit	ok
18:05	Alberth	having problems with window size?
18:06		*** telanus left #openttd (PING 1336323968)
18:06	hackalittlebit	no, just if you redesign opening (eg 'new game')window, it would be nice to know limmits
18:07	hackalittlebit	see fs5147
18:07	Alberth	not so whether that counts as 'opening window', in my mind once you clicked 'new game', you have started to use the program
18:08	Alberth	I would only consider the intro screen window to be the opening window
18:08	hackalittlebit	ok
18:08	Alberth	and that one should be small, but that's not a big issue, I think
18:09	hackalittlebit	that one could be smaller and more simple
18:09	Alberth	I hope you make a nice design
18:09	hackalittlebit	
18:10	Alberth	I do like the direction it is going
18:11	hackalittlebit	other question:Would you guys be interested in getting rid of that basic 'Game Options' screen
18:12	hackalittlebit	or is that to radical
18:12	Alberth	I'd like that
18:12	hackalittlebit	me to
18:13	Alberth	imho the game options, difficulty and advanced settings are all doing the same kind of thing, and should be merged
18:13	hackalittlebit	agreed
18:14	hackalittlebit	but that shoul be discussed in later stage
18:14		Alberth tries to remember why that failed the last time (several years ago)
18:14	hackalittlebit	try to keep game as original as possible maybe
18:15	Alberth	iirc, the high-score button was a problem in difficulties, and the long list of values in game options
18:15	hackalittlebit	those are settings from the beginning
18:15	Alberth	but this was before I was a dev, and before the big gui system rewrite
18:15	frosch123	i considered the game options as some kind of system settings
18:15	frosch123	language and screen resolution
18:15	frosch123	i.e. those things which have nothing to do with the actual game
18:16	Alberth	PaulC had similar ideas, it could be good to keep them separate
18:16	Alberth	hackalittlebit: so yeah, we have ideas etc
18:17	frosch123	the difficulty window otoh should just be dropped
18:17	frosch123	and the stuff from it should be moved to genworld resp. advanced settings
18:17	frosch123	resp. ai settings
18:17	Alberth	but gui design should be done in very small steps imho, otherwise it gets too complicated very fast
18:17	hackalittlebit	agreed
18:17	frosch123	yup
18:18	frosch123	imo worldgen is the first step, since we progressed the furthest in that design
18:18	frosch123	that would include removing options from the game options which we move there
18:18	frosch123	second would imo be removal of difficulty settings
18:18	frosch123	since there are very few things left after the worldgen window is done
18:19	hackalittlebit	frosh123: would it be possible to define what are basic and what are advanced options?
18:20	hackalittlebit	in world generator window
18:20	frosch123	i made a proposal for that
18:20	hackalittlebit	saw it
18:20	frosch123	no idea who agrees or disagrees with that selection
18:21		*** telanus1 joined #openttd
18:21	frosch123	<- for the rest in the channel
18:22	hackalittlebit	think about date for example
18:22	hackalittlebit	that was not in original game
18:23	TrueBrain	Wolf01: I hope you don't mind I am about to steal your Brickland name, the set you started in 2007
18:23	frosch123	i don't think that is a useful criterion
18:23	hackalittlebit	and another doubt that i have is those 4 buttons for making map edge.
18:23	frosch123	i really like those 4 buttons as advanced settings
18:23	Wolf01	TrueBrain: instead I'm glad somebody had taken it up again
18:23	frosch123	sometimes i want to play on a map which has coast only on one side
18:24	TrueBrain	Wolf01:
18:24	hackalittlebit	realy
18:24	hackalittlebit	
18:25	frosch123	hackalittlebit: there was a issue with date and snowline in scenario editor
18:25	frosch123	while you can actually change the date after map generation
18:25	frosch123	you cannot change the snowline
18:26	hackalittlebit	changing date also in cheat window
18:26	frosch123	changing the snowlines causes somewhat trouble for original houses, but other than that i think scenario creators would want to change the snowline later on
18:27	frosch123	hackalittlebit: i am only talking about scenario editor
18:27	hackalittlebit	ok
18:27	frosch123	and the se has no cheats
18:27	Alberth	the se *is* a cheat
18:27	Eddi|zuHause	hackalittlebit: i would put town names into advanced
18:27	frosch123	e.g. one could remove the date from the se editor mapgen window, since there is no much point in it
18:28	frosch123	Eddi|zuHause: definitely not
18:28	frosch123	it's a setting everyone understands, and esp. when using town name grfs it must be easy to find
18:29	frosch123	currently it is really stupid that if you add a townname grf you have to go to the game options to select them
18:29	Alberth	frosch123: or even select it automagically ?
18:29	frosch123	Alberth: there are multiple namesets in a townname grf
18:29	frosch123	though you could show some hint if none of them is used
18:29	Alberth	not in mine
18:29	frosch123	german town names have like 10 or so
18:30	frosch123	real, fictional, north, west, east, south, and various combinations thereof
18:30	Alberth	suppress the default, and force the user to make a choice, or is that too strong?
18:31	frosch123	they are already separated in the dropdown
18:31	frosch123	first the newgrf ones, then a separator line, then the original ones
18:35	Alberth	yeah, but you have to know that
