17:30	<HackaLittleBit>	frosch123:Land generator and variety distribution, I consider more advanced, what more do you consider 'advanced'? fs5147
17:30	<HackaLittleBit>	snow line?
17:31	<frosch123>	tree algorithm and rivers
17:31	<HackaLittleBit>	should only be visible when you choose arctic climate
17:31	<frosch123>	and road vehicle side
17:31	<frosch123>	nothing you want to change every day
17:31	<HackaLittleBit>	ah
17:31	<frosch123>	well, road vehicle side is easy to understand
17:31	<frosch123>	but who cares about tree algorithm :)
17:32	<HackaLittleBit>	nobody
17:32	<frosch123>	variety distribution and landgen type are hard to understand
17:32	<HackaLittleBit>	I just foud out today
17:32	<frosch123>	and river count is actually quite useless, since the amount of rivers depends a lot more on smoothness :p
17:32	<frosch123>	map edges might also be advanced
17:33	<frosch123>	not sure about snow line, might be non-advanced
17:34	<HackaLittleBit>	I do think you should leave those things, It is nice to tinker with and if you do not like the map , just delete it :)
17:34	<HackaLittleBit>	only tree algorithem should disapear
17:35	<HackaLittleBit>	who gives a sh..

17:36	<supermop>	trees should be grouped by species
17:37	<supermop>	at least there should be different restrictions on different types
17:38	<HackaLittleBit>	supermop: Only today I found out that 'variety distribution' was not for trees :)
17:39	<HackaLittleBit>	but grouping by species is highly desired here
17:39	<HackaLittleBit>	or according to height
17:44	<@Terkhen>	good night
17:45	<HackaLittleBit>	frosch123: What about renaming 'Terrain type' in 'Terrain' and adding two more options. 1 Totally Flat and 2 From Heightmap. Eliminat 2 buttons on top
17:45	<HackaLittleBit>	goodnight
17:46	<frosch123>	i think heightmap should be separate
17:46	<HackaLittleBit>	ok
17:46	<frosch123>	it's very different from the other things

17:46	<frosch123>	more like a scenario
17:47	<frosch123>	totally flat is fine for se
17:47	<HackaLittleBit>	ok
17:47	<frosch123>	but personally i don't like it for new games
17:47	<HackaLittleBit>	agreed
17:47	<frosch123>	i want to force players to play on interesting maps :p

17:48	<HackaLittleBit>	I tested a bit and I cant see so many difference between 'Flat' and 'Very flat'
17:49	<HackaLittleBit>	I think one should be enough
17:49	<frosch123>	the problem with the map settings is, that they depend a lot on each other
17:49	<frosch123>	so the difference of flat and very flat depends on climate, variety, smoothness, and maybe even more
17:50	<frosch123>	e.g. tropic is generally flat, while artic is generally hilly
17:50	<frosch123>	very smooth is generally more flat
17:50	<frosch123>	and high variety distribution is also likely to be very flat in parts
17:50	<HackaLittleBit>	Yeah I saw that in the wiki
17:51	<HackaLittleBit>	So that is why cutting more options is difficult
17:52	<frosch123>	i don't think more options within a dropdown are an issue
17:52	<Someus>	I can't wait for 32-bit graphics
17:52	<frosch123>	but dropdowns which are hard to get the meaning of are :)
17:52	<HackaLittleBit>	That is next discussion
17:53	<HackaLittleBit>	first layout
17:53	<frosch123>	Someus: easy to get used to. many people are waiting for them for like 6 years
17:53	<Someus>	OMG
17:53	<Someus>	:D
17:54	<HackaLittleBit>	frosch123:What I proposed is technically feasable, without to much hassle?
17:54	<frosch123>	what do you mean specifically?
17:54	<frosch123>	the hiding of widgets depending on the selection of others?
17:55	<HackaLittleBit>	well hiding options, changing screen size on the fly
17:55	<frosch123>	we have such stuff in the orders window
17:55	<HackaLittleBit>	ok
17:55	<frosch123>	so, yes, changing size and expanding stuff is no problem
17:56	<HackaLittleBit>	But do you agree with layout?
17:56	<HackaLittleBit>	Can't do much more there
17:57	<HackaLittleBit>	or you have to specifically ask
17:58	<Someus>	Hmmm.. are there any other type of transport? :)
17:58	<frosch123>	my main concern is that there should be some room for advanced settings, which are hidden
17:58	<Someus>	We have plaines, buses, trains, ships, what else we have?
17:58	<frosch123>	making everything visible to the new user seems too much
17:58	<frosch123>	Someus: trams, various other train types
17:59	<frosch123>	trucks
17:59	<HackaLittleBit>	ok, I have to think
17:59	<frosch123>	Someus: so, you might have narrow gauge, or metro, ...
18:00	<frosch123>	heqs are also different from other trucks
18:01	<HackaLittleBit>	frosch123: would it be possible with advanced button to show up more items on the screen?

18:02	<frosch123>	sure, it's technically the same as hiding single comboboxes
18:02	<frosch123>	or like the general window shading we have
18:02	<HackaLittleBit>	ok I'll come back to you
18:02	<HackaLittleBit>	godnight
18:02	<frosch123>	night
18:02	<HackaLittleBit>	goodnight
