10:50	<frosch123>	is there something new?
10:50	<hackalittlebit>	yep
10:51	<frosch123>	if you mean the stuff you posted 2 hours ago, i already replied one hour ago
10:52	<hackalittlebit>	hu
10:52	<hackalittlebit>	i'll have a look
10:54	<@planetmaker>	hackalittlebit: what is contained in the attached zip?
10:54	<@planetmaker>	(I don't like the need to download and unzip stuff)
10:54	<@planetmaker>	it's extra work and a border to review things
10:55	<hackalittlebit>	planetmaker: I did that for alberth
10:55	<hackalittlebit>	desiign
10:56	<@planetmaker>	?
10:56	<hackalittlebit>	but I can make one file no problem
10:56	<frosch123>	planetmaker: http://devs.openttd.org/~frosch/fs5147/se4/map_generator_2.html
10:58	<hackalittlebit>	frosch123: point one ok
10:58	<hackalittlebit>	point 2 snow line is scenery in odel railroading
10:58	<hackalittlebit>	model
10:58	<@planetmaker>	ty, frosch123
10:59	*	frosch123 never saw snow on a model railroad
11:00	<hackalittlebit>	hold on
11:00	<@planetmaker>	I wonder whether town names belong there... Probably yes. But it would be nice to have a way to consider the NewGRF town names as an option in the dropdown, too. Even if not (yet) configured in the NewGRF list. But it might be well out of scope here
11:00	<frosch123>	hackalittlebit: google image search provides some hints :)

11:02	<hackalittlebit>	hehe
11:02	<@planetmaker>	ah, nice, frosch123
11:03	<@planetmaker>	frosch123: I actually wonder whether should remove the visibility of the old watery map edge...
11:03	<frosch123>	hmm, modeling footsteps in the snow on a model railroad sounds like a lot of effort
11:04	<@planetmaker>	it's a setting we can't remove. But do we need it for new maps?
11:04	<frosch123>	planetmaker: i like the expanding thing for those options
11:04	<frosch123>	and it's not at all about old vs. new
11:04	<frosch123>	but about choosing between island, inland or coast
11:04	<@planetmaker>	yes, I like that expansion for adv., too
11:05	<frosch123>	and FLHerne said he uses that setting every day :p
11:06	<@planetmaker>	:-D
11:06	<@planetmaker>	you find that statement probably for every single setting by one person or another ;-)
11:06	<FLHerne>	That's why you should have customisable menus :P
11:07	<FLHerne>	Then people can put in the options they use often

11:08	<hackalittlebit>	but the options are saved, aren't they

11:09	<FLHerne>	Sorry, I mean customisable creation screens/option panels
11:09	<FLHerne>	Menus would be good too though :P
11:15	<hackalittlebit>	frosh123: do 'new game' 'advanced' 'show al', it will show you that place behind terrain type is occupied
11:16	<hackalittlebit>	maybe put height beside map dimensions?
11:17	<hackalittlebit>	frosch123: read above
11:22	<frosch123>	hackalittlebit: you have either height or variety, not both
11:23	<frosch123>	and putting height next to totally flat makes a lot of sense
11:24	<hackalittlebit>	press 'se', 'terrain type hilly', advaced
11:25	<frosch123>	and then?
11:26	<hackalittlebit>	is that technically possible?
11:26	<frosch123>	what?
11:27	<hackalittlebit>	one widget in same position as other
11:27	<frosch123>	yes, you can switch between them then
11:27	<hackalittlebit>	then consider it done
11:27	<hackalittlebit>	and snow height?
11:28	<hackalittlebit>	I like it were it is
11:28	<hackalittlebit>	only shows up in arctic

11:36	<frosch123>	i have no real opinon on the snow line
11:36	<frosch123>	i only wondered what could be moved to the second column of the map part
11:37	<frosch123>	and moving snow line would open the option to move the rv side to the second coulumn
11:37	<frosch123>	so almost all lines would have two things and the whole window would look less empty on the right
11:39	<hackalittlebit>	posted updated version
11:40	<frosch123>	what's next?
11:42	<hackalittlebit>	hehe I'll see if we can improve understandebility of options. I will post proposal
11:43	<hackalittlebit>	I have to go, see you
11:43	<frosch123>	bye
