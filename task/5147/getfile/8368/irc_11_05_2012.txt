16:41	<frosch123>	hackalittlebit: yes, but sadly there is no convergence in sight :) all new layouts are very different from the others
16:42	<frosch123>	it would be nice if we could first settle what settings are advanced and which not
16:42	<CIA-1>	OpenTTD: rubidium * r24224 /trunk/src/newgrf_industries.cpp: -Fix [FS#5159]: dereferencing uninitialised pointer (frosch)
16:42	<frosch123>	in your last layout you really surprised me by making the start date an advanced setting :)
16:43	<hackalittlebit>	was not in original game
16:43	<drac_boy>	doesn't matter
16:43	<drac_boy>	1920 is not advanced
16:43	<drac_boy>	:)
16:43	<frosch123>	more than 1492 :p
16:44	<hackalittlebit>	for me fine I'll put it back.
16:45	<hackalittlebit>	Yuo wan't to study it a bit more?
16:46	<frosch123>	maybe we should hold a short survey for every setting, whether they are advanced, not so advanced, or questionably advanced
16:46	<drac_boy>	frosch123 as long as you don't list all the stupid little things :)
16:46	<drac_boy>	especially colour newspapers
16:46	<drac_boy>	heh heh
16:46	<Rubidium>	come on, you need three levels of advancedness: noob (type of map (4 options), size: 5 options: tiny, small, medium, large, huge)
16:46	<frosch123>	i mean only mapgen stuff :)
16:47	<frosch123>	yeah, we should add password protection for maps bigger than 512x512 :p
16:48	<hackalittlebit>	wait a second , I will post tomorrow list with all options.
16:48	<hackalittlebit>	then we can go item by item
16:49	<hackalittlebit>	just an idea, would a reset button do?
16:49	<hackalittlebit>	reset to original state
16:50	<drac_boy>	whats "original" tho silly?
16:52	<frosch123>	i don't think there is any reasonable default or original state
16:52	<hackalittlebit>	he he
16:52	<frosch123>	we discussed dropping the weird difficulty options, so then there would be even less defaults
16:53	<Rubidium>	use the settings that approximate the default settings for the single climate demo version?
16:55	<hackalittlebit>	rubidium: In fact there should be something like that. realy setting game state back to when you downloaded for the first time
16:56	<hackalittlebit>	coreldraw has it
16:57	<hackalittlebit>	and I saw somewere in FS you had problems with default settings
16:57	<Rubidium>	I doubt that, maybe to the 'factory' settings of the currently installed version, but not the factory settings on the version you installed first (and then upgraded the heck away from)
16:57	<hackalittlebit>	ok
16:57	<Rubidium>	but for that just close openttd and trash openttd.cfg
16:58	<hackalittlebit>	so then it would be easy to solve
16:59	<hackalittlebit>	restart game
17:04	<hackalittlebit>	rubidium:fs5154
17:05	<hackalittlebit>	moment you can not read var, use original
17:05	<Rubidium>	it does that

17:05	<Rubidium>	that's not what fs5154 is about
17:07	<Rubidium>	the bug is about crashing because it tries to tell you that a setting is incorrect using the string system
17:07	<Rubidium>	which coincidentally isn't loaded at that time yet
17:08	<Rubidium>	mostly due to only being able to load it after knowing the language, which will only be known after loading the bunch of settings that it are troublesome w.r.t. 5154
17:10	<hackalittlebit>	fs5153
17:10	<hackalittlebit>	made by eddy
17:10	<hackalittlebit>	eddi
17:14	<Rubidium>	what point are you trying to make?

17:19	<hackalittlebits>	For new users it should be possible to mees around and try and knowing they can go back to clean state
17:20	<hackalittlebits>	I my self have that with new software

17:36	<hackalittlebits>	ok, I'll make changes and lets see :)
