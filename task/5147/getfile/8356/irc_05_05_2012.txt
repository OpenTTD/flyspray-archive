13:33	HackaLittleBit	frosch123: hello frosch, can I talk a about fs5147
13:33	HackaLittleBit	would it not be a idea to create small svn repository to show changes?
13:33	HackaLittleBit	and keep track of suggestions.
13:34		*** Hazzard quit (Quit: Page closed)
13:34	HackaLittleBit	I have basic document structure ready, but still many changes to be done.
13:35	frosch123	hmm, isn't there already some project on coop for that?
13:35	HackaLittleBit	give link pls.
13:35	frosch123	http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/openttd-gui <- found it
13:37	frosch123	alternatively we could use the wiki
13:38	frosch123	i am not sure how much of a history tracking is needed
13:38	frosch123	so, a hg repo might be too much, compared to a wiki site with some images
13:43	HackaLittleBit	This weekend I'll upload the document. Most of the work was getting the structure correct. Proposed changes are not all implemented. The suggestion from albert to put loading height map in the world generator makes a lot of sense. The idea is to make changes in foto first
13:43	frosch123	planetmaker: are you available for discussion?
13:44	HackaLittleBit	only when layout is correct do programming
13:48	HackaLittleBit	frosch123: If you wan't I can upload now in order to have a quick look.
13:50	frosch123	no idea, what do you need? a wiki site? just some storage site for documents? or a repository?
13:50	HackaLittleBit	svn repository with commit rights.
13:50	frosch123	the coop redmine has kind of all of those three
13:51	frosch123	coop uses hg, not svn
13:51	HackaLittleBit	I'll check it out and come back to you
13:51	HackaLittleBit	duno hg
13:52	frosch123	are you registered on the devzone?
13:52	HackaLittleBit	no
13:52	frosch123	what shall the project be named?
13:53	HackaLittleBit	GUI
13:53	Zuu	Get Unified Interface?
13:53		drac_boy pokes zuu
13:54	frosch123	well, i assume you want to upload the html preview trickery. so, something like "gui design cases"? as subproject of the "openttd-gui" project?
13:54	HackaLittleBit	fine with me.
13:54	frosch123	just "gui" sounds weird as subproject of "openttd-gui"
13:55	HackaLittleBit	hold on pls
13:56	HackaLittleBit	'gui design tracking'
13:56	HackaLittleBit	is that better?
13:56	frosch123	i think we can also change that later on, so just "gui design" for now
13:57	HackaLittleBit	ok
13:58		*** pugi quit ()
13:59	frosch123	http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/openttd-gui-design <- if you register, i can add you as manager
13:59	HackaLittleBit	frosch123: I'll upload doc to FS now juast to have a look.
13:59	frosch123	we have to wait for some admin though to make it a subproject of openttd-gui
13:59		*** drac_boy left #openttd (I'm done being in this room!)
14:03	Ammler	frosch123: done
14:03	frosch123	thanks
14:03	HackaLittleBit	Thnks Ammler
14:04	HackaLittleBit	frosch123: Uploaded doc!
14:05	frosch123	wrong task though
14:06	HackaLittleBit	Hu how many rights did you give me?
14:06	frosch123	what?
14:07	HackaLittleBit	pls delete in fs3826
14:07	HackaLittleBit	indeed wrong task.
14:09	HackaLittleBit	ok now it's correct task.5147
14:13	frosch123	are those all windows?
14:14	frosch123	all settings windows i guess
14:15	HackaLittleBit	not yet all , I think some still missing.
14:15	frosch123	i guess settings are most interesting
14:15	Zuu	I read some changes that doesn't seem to be reflected in the image.
14:17	HackaLittleBit	Zuu: I have been busy with document structure there may be inconsistencies.
14:17	HackaLittleBit	that is reason for svn
14:17	Zuu	I understand its a work in progress.
14:17	HackaLittleBit	I am loosing track of changes
14:17	HackaLittleBit	yep
14:18	HackaLittleBit	just in the beginning
14:21	planetmaker	hm, sorry, I'm here now. What's up?
14:21	frosch123	planetmaker: all fine
14:22	frosch123	planetmaker: we made a new subproject to one of your existing ones ttp/dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/openttd-gui-design
14:22	frosch123	to keep track of fs#5147 thingies
14:22	planetmaker	ah, ok. That's nice
14:23		andythenorth may be winning at internets
14:23	andythenorth	mostly css
14:24	planetmaker	in principle you can have also svn or git repo type on devzone. But hg repos are the default which need no admin intervention
14:24	andythenorth	no FIRS release this weekend
14:24	planetmaker	HackaLittleBit: svn is a bad vcs though, if you want to supply patches
14:24	planetmaker	patch queues that is
14:24		*** Elukka joined #openttd
14:24	frosch123	svn is more than half as old as cvs
14:25	planetmaker	
14:25	planetmaker	and hg half as old as svn?
14:25	HackaLittleBit	I have tortoisesvn installed here
14:25	frosch123	planetmaker: yes, hg is more than half as old as svn
14:26	planetmaker	then you'll like tortoiseHG, HackaLittleBit
14:26	frosch123	and more than a quarter as old as cvs, but not yet a third
14:26	HackaLittleBit	won't that mess up my installation?
14:27	HackaLittleBit	I mean can the two live side by side?
14:28	NGC3982	im nowhere.
14:28	NGC3982	rural sweden is so odd..
14:29	HackaLittleBit	andythenorth: mostly css, still IE has problems swallowing.
14:30	HackaLittleBit	was tested in opera chrome FF ok.
14:30		*** Zuu_ joined #openttd
14:30		*** roboboy quit (Ping timeout: 480 seconds)
