+STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_SEMAPHORE_NORM_TIP                             :{BLACK}Block Signal (semaphore){}This is the most basic type of signal, allowing only one train to be in the same block at the same time.
 STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_SEMAPHORE_ENTRY_TIP                            :{BLACK}Entry-Signal (semaphore){}Green as long as there is one or more green exit-signal from the following section of track. Otherwise it shows red.
 STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_SEMAPHORE_EXIT_TIP                             :{BLACK}Exit-Signal (semaphore){}Behaves in the same way as a block signal but is necessary to trigger the correct color on entry & combo pre-signals.
 STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_SEMAPHORE_COMBO_TIP                            :{BLACK}Combo-Signal (semaphore){}The combo signal simply acts as both an entry and exit signal. This allows you to build large "trees" of presignals.
-STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_SEMAPHORE_PBS_TIP                              :{BLACK}Advanced Signal (semaphore){}An advanced signal allows more than one train to enter a signal block at the same time, if the train can reserve a path to a safe stopping point. Advanced signals can be passed from the backside.
-STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_SEMAPHORE_PBS_OWAY_TIP                         :{BLACK}One-way Advanced Signal (semaphore){}An advanced signal allows more than one train to enter a signal block at the same time, if the train can reserve a path to a safe stopping point. One-way signals cannot be passed from the backside.
-STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_ELECTRIC_NORM_TIP                              :{BLACK}Standard Signal (electric){}Signals are necessary to keep trains from crashing on railway networks with more than one train.
+STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_SEMAPHORE_PBS_TIP                              :{BLACK}Path Signal (semaphore){}A path signal allows more than one train to enter a signal block at the same time, if the train can reserve a path to a safe stopping point. Standard path signals can be passed from the back side.
+STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_SEMAPHORE_PBS_OWAY_TIP                         :{BLACK}One-way Path Signal (semaphore){}A path signal allows more than one train to enter a signal block at the same time, if the train can reserve a path to a safe stopping point. One-way path signals cannot be passed from the back side.

 STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_ELECTRIC_ENTRY_TIP                             :{BLACK}Entry-Signal (electric){}Green as long as there is one or more green exit-signal from the following section of track. Otherwise it shows red.
 STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_ELECTRIC_EXIT_TIP                              :{BLACK}Exit-Signal (electric){}Behaves in the same way as a block signal but is necessary to trigger the correct color on entry & combo pre-signals.
 STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_ELECTRIC_COMBO_TIP                             :{BLACK}Combo-Signal (electric){}The combo signal simply acts as both an entry and exit signal. This allows you to build large "trees" of presignals.

-STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_ELECTRIC_PBS_OWAY_TIP                          :{BLACK}One-way Advanced Signal (electric){}An advanced signal allows more than one train to enter a signal block at the same time, if the train can reserve a path to a safe stopping point. One-way signals cannot be passed from the backside.
+STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_ELECTRIC_PBS_TIP                               :{BLACK}Path Signal (electric){}A path signal allows more than one train to enter a signal block at the same time, if the train can reserve a path to a safe stopping point. Standard path signals can be passed from the back side.
+STR_BUILD_SIGNAL_ELECTRIC_PBS_OWAY_TIP                          :{BLACK}One-way Path Signal (electric){}A path signal allows more than one train to enter a signal block at the same time, if the train can reserve a path to a safe stopping point. One-way path signals cannot be passed from the back side.
 STR_SIGNAL_CONVERT_TIP                                          :{BLACK}Signal Convert{}When selected, clicking an existing signal will convert it to the selected signal type and variant, CTRL-click will toggle the existing variant.
 STR_DRAG_SIGNALS_DENSITY_TIP                                    :{BLACK}Dragging signal density
 STR_DRAG_SIGNALS_DENSITY_DECREASE_TIP                           :{BLACK}Decrease dragging signal density
