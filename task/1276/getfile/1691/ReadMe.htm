</span></b></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>OpenTTD is a clone of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, a popular
game originally written by Chris Sawyer.  It attempts to mimic the original
game as closely as possible while extending it with new features.<br>
<br>
OpenTTD is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.0. For more
information, see the file 'COPYING'.<br>

</span></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The easiest way to contact the OpenTTD team is by
submitting bug reports or posting comments in our forums. You can also chat
with us on IRC (#openttd on irc.oftc.net ).<br>

color:teal'>2.1) Reporting Bugs:<br>
</span></b></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>To report a bug, please create a Flyspray account and
follow the bugs link from our homepage. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Please make sure the bug is reproducible and still occurs
in the latest daily build or the current SVN version. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Also please look through the existing bug reports briefly
to see whether the bug is not already known.<br>
<br>
The Flyspray project page URL is: <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org/">http://bugs.openttd.org/</a></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Please include the following information in your bug
report:<br>
        - OpenTTD version (PLEASE test the latest SVN/nightly build)<br>
        - Bug details, including instructions how to reproduce it<br>
        - Platform and compiler (Win32, Linux, FreeBSD, ...)<br>
        - Attach a saved game or a screenshot if possible<br>
        - If this bug only occurred recently please note the last<br>
          version without the bug and the first version including<br>
          the bug. That way we can fix it quicker by looking at the<br>
          changes made.<br>

<a name="Platforms_30"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:teal'>3.0)
Supported Platforms:<br>
</span></b></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>OpenTTD has been ported to several platforms and
operating systems. It shouldn't be very difficult to port it to a new platform.
The currently working platforms are:<br>
<br>
  BeOS                 - SDL<br>
  FreeBSD              - SDL<br>
  Linux                - SDL<br>
  MacOS X (universal)  - Cocoa video and sound drivers (SDL works too, but not
100% and not as a universal binary)<br>
  MorphOS              - SDL<br>
  OpenBSD              - SDL<br>
  OS/2                 - SDL<br>
  Windows              - Win32 GDI (faster) or SDL<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="Running_40"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:teal'>4.0) Running
OpenTTD:<br>
</span></b></a><br>
Before you run OpenTTD, you need to put the game's datafiles into the “/data” subdirectory.
</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>You need the following files from the original version of
TTD as OpenTTD makes use of the original TTD artwork.<br>
<br>
List of the required files:<br>
sample.cat<br>
trg1r.grf<br>
trgcr.grf<br>
trghr.grf<br>
trgir.grf<br>
trgtr.grf<br>
<br>
(Alternatively you can use the TTD GRF files from the DOS version: TRG1.GRF, TRGC.GRF,
TRGH.GRF, TRGI.GRF, TRGT.GRF. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>A few minor graphical glitches with the DOS graphics
remain. E.g. the autorail button in the rail toolbar doesn't look as nice as
with the Windows graphics.)<br>
<br>
If you want music you need to copy the “/gm” folder from Windows TTD into your OpenTTD
folder, not your data folder.<br>
<br>
You can change the data path (which contains savegames as well) in Makefile.config
by setting DATA_DIR_PREFIX and USE_HOMEDIR.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="Features_50"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:teal'>5.0) OpenTTD
features:<br>
</span></b></a><br>
OpenTTD has a lot of features going beyond the original TTD emulation.<br>
Unfortunately, there is currently no comprehensive list of features, but there is
a basic features list on the web, and some optional features can be controlled
through the Configure Patches dialog. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>We also implement some features known from TTDPatch ( <a
href="http://www.ttdpatch.net/">http://www.ttdpatch.net/</a> ).<br>
<br>
Several important non-standard controls:<br>
<br>
* Use Ctrl to place semaphore signals<br>
* Ctrl-D toggles double mode in the Windows version<br>
* Ingame console. More information at <a
href="http://wiki.openttd.org/index.php/Console">http://wiki.openttd.org/index.php/Console</a></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><a name="Configuration_60"><b><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;color:teal'>6.0) Configuration File:<br>
</span></b></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The configuration file for OpenTTD (openttd.cfg) is in a
simple Windows-like “.INI” format. It's mostly undocumented. Almost all
settings can be changed ingame by using the 'Configure Patches' window.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="Compiling_70"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:teal'>7.0)
Compiling:<br>
</span></b></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><b>Windows:<br>
</b>  You need Microsoft Visual Studio .NET. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Open the project file and it should build automatically. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>In case you want to build with SDL support you need to
add WITH_SDL to the project settings.<br>
PNG (WITH_PNG) and ZLIB (WITH_ZLIB) support is enabled by default. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>For these to work you need their development files. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>For best results, download the openttd-useful.zip file
from SourceForge under the Files tab. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Put the header files into your compiler's “/include” directory
and the library (.lib) files into the “/lib” directory.<br>
For more help with VS see docs/Readme_Windows_MSVC.txt.<br>
<br>
  You can also build it using the Makefile with MSYS/MinGW or
Cygwin/MinGW.<br>
  Please read the Makefile for more information.<br>
<br>
<b>Solaris 10:<br>
</b>  You need g++ (version 3 or higher), together with SDL. Installation of
libpng and zlib is recommended. For the first build it is required to execute
&quot;bash configure&quot; first. Note that ./configure does not work yet. It
is likely that you don't have a strip binary, so use the --disable-strip option
in that case. Fontconfig (&gt;2.3.0) and freetype are optional. &quot;make
run&quot; will then run the program.<br>
<br>
<b>Unix:<br>
</b>  OpenTTD can be built with GNU &quot;make&quot;. On non-GNU systems it's
called &quot;gmake&quot;.<br>
  However, for the first build one has to do a &quot;./configure&quot;
first.<br>
  Note that you need SDL-devel 1.2.5 (or higher) to compile OpenTTD.<br>
<br>
<b>MacOS X:<br>
</b>  Use &quot;make&quot; or Xcode (which will then call make for you)<br>
  This will give you a binary for your CPU type (PPC/Intel)<br>
  However, for the first build one has to do a &quot;./configure&quot;
first.<br>
  To make a universal binary type &quot;./configure --enabled-universal&quot;
instead of &quot;./configure&quot;.<br>
<br>
<b>BeOS:<br>
</b>  Use &quot;make&quot;, but do a &quot;./configure&quot; before the first
build.<br>
<br>
<b>FreeBSD:<br>
</b>  You need the port devel/sdl12 for a non-dedicated build.<br>
  graphics/png is optional for screenshots in the PNG format.<br>
  Use &quot;gmake&quot;, but do a &quot;./configure&quot; before the first
build.<br>
<br>
<b>OpenBSD:<br>
</b>  Use &quot;gmake&quot;, but do a &quot;./configure&quot; before the first
build.<br>
  Note that you need the port devel/sdl to compile OpenTTD.<br>
<br>
<b>MorphOS:<br>
</b>  Use &quot;make&quot;. However, for the first build one has to do a
&quot;./configure&quot; first.<br>
  Note that you need the MorphOS SDK, latest libnix updates (else C++ parts of OpenTTD
will not build) and the powersdl.library SDK. Optionally libz, libpng and
freetype2 developer files.<br>
<br>
<b>OS/2:<br>
</b>  A comprehensive GNU build environment is required to build the OS/2
version.<br>
  See the docs/Readme_OS2.txt file for more information.<br>

Translating:<br>
</span></b></a><br>
See <a href="http://www.openttd.org/translating.php">http://www.openttd.org/translating.php</a>
for up-to-date information.<br>
<br>
The use of the online Translator service, located at <a
href="http://translator2.openttd.org/">http://translator2.openttd.org/</a> , is
highly encouraged. For a username/password combo you should contact the
development team, either by mail, IRC or the forums. The system is
straightforward to use, and if you have any problems, read the online help
located there.<br>
<br>
If for some reason the website is down for a longer period of time, the information
below might be of help.<br>
 &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><a name="Guidelines_81"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
color:teal'>8.1) Guidelines:<br>
</span></b></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Here are some translation guidelines which you should
follow closely.<br>
<br>
    * Please contact the development team before beginning the translation
process! This avoids double work, as someone else may have already started
translating to the same language.<br>
    * Translators must use the character set ISO 8859-15. Otherwise, some
characters will not display correctly in the game.<br>
    * Currently it is not possible to translate into character sets other than
Latin.<br>
<br>
<a name="Translation_82"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:teal'>8.2)
Translation:<br>
</span></b></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>So, now that you've notified the development team about
your intention to translate (You did, right? Of course you did.) you can pick
up english.txt (found in the SVN repository under “/lang”) and translate.<br>
<br>
You must change the first two lines of the file appropriately:<br>
<br>
##name English-Name-Of-Language<br>
##ownname Native-Name-Of-Language<br>
<br>
Note: Do not alter the following parts of the file:<br>
<br>
    * String identifiers (the first word on each line)<br>
    * Parts of the strings which are in curly braces (such as {STRING})<br>
    * Lines beginning with ## (such as ##id), other than the first two lines of
the file<br>
<br>
<a name="Previewing_83"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:teal'>8.3)
Previewing:<br>
</span></b></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>In order to view the translation in the game, you need to
compile your language file with the strgen utility, which is now bundled with
the game.<br>
<br>
strgen is a command-line utility. It takes the language filename as
parameter.<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
strgen lang/german.txt<br>
<br>
This results in compiling german.txt and produces another file named
german.lng.<br>
Any missing strings are replaced with the English strings. Note that it looks for
english.txt in the lang subdirectory, which is where your language file should
also be.<br>
<br>
That's all! You should now be able to select the language in the game
options.<br>
 &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><a name="Troubleshooting_90"><b><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;color:teal'>9.0) Troubleshooting<br>
</span></b></a><br>
To see all startup options available to you, start OpenTTD with the &quot;./openttd
-h&quot; option. This might help you tweak some of the settings.<br>
<br>
If the game is acting strange and you feel adventurous you can try the &quot;-d
[[&lt;name&gt;]=[&lt;level&gt;]&quot; flag, where the higher levels will give
you more debugging output. The &quot;name&quot; variable can help you to
display only some type of debugging messages. This is mostly undocumented so
best is to look in the source code file debug.c for the various debugging
types. For more information look at <a
href="http://wiki.openttd.org/index.php/Command_line">http://wiki.openttd.org/index.php/Command_line</a>
.<br>
<br>
The most frequent problem is missing data files. Don't forget to put all GRF files
from TTD into your “/data” folder including sample.cat!<br>
<br>
Under Windows 98 and lower it is impossible to use a dedicated server; it will fail
to start. Perhaps this is for the better because those OS's are not known for
their stability.<br>
<br>
With the added support for font-based text selecting a non-latin language will result
in garbage (lots of '?') shown on screen. Please open your configuration file
and add a desired font for small/medium/-and large_font. This can be a
font<br>
name like &quot;Tahoma&quot; or a path to a font.<br>
<br>
Any NewGRF file used in a game is stored inside the savegame and will refuse to
load if you don't have that grf file available. A list of missing files will be
output to the console at the moment, so use the '-d' flag (on windows) to see
this list. You just have to find the files ( <a
href="http://grfcrawler.tt-forums.net/">http://grfcrawler.tt-forums.net/</a> ),
put them in the “/data” folder and you're set to go.<br>
