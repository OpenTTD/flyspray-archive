# Flyspray Archive

In 2018 the bug-tracker (Flyspray) used by OpenTTD was migrated to GitHub.
All textual information has been carried over with the same identifier as it had on Flyspray.

However, adding the attachments turned out to be difficult.
As such, they are published in this GitHub repository, so one can still access the attachments.
